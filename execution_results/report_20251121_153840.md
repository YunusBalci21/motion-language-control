### 3. Walk forward slowly


    **LLM Reasoning:**
    ```
    Okay, so I need to figure out how to make this robot walk forward slowly based on the user's command. Let me break it down step by step.

First, when the user says "walk forward slowly," that means the robot should move in the direction it's currently facing but at a reduced speed. So, I guess I have to consider both the movement and the speed control.

I remember from earlier that there were some basic movements like moving straight or turning left/right. Maybe those can be used here too. But since we want slow movement, perhaps adjusting the speed parameter is necessary.

Wait, does the robot have different speeds for different actions? Like maybe walking vs running. If not, maybe just slowing down the existing walking motion would work.

So, first, I'll tell the robot to face a certain direction—let's say north for simplicity. Then, instead of using the full speed, I'll use a lower value, like 0.5 times the maximum speed. That way, it moves slower than usual without stopping completely.

Putting it all together, the sequence would involve telling the robot to turn towards north if it's not already facing that direction, then proceed with a reduced speed.
    ```

    **Motion Plan:** walk forward slowly

### 4. Stop moving


    **LLM Reasoning:**
    ```

    ```

    **Motion Plan:** stop moving

    **Results:**
    - Similarity: 0.107
    - Success Rate: 100.0%
    - Motion Quality: 0.492

    
### 5. Turn right and walk forward


    **LLM Reasoning:**
    ```
    Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the robot should respond when the user says, "Turn right and walk forward." Let me break this down step by step.

First off, turning right means that the robot needs to change its direction. If it was facing north before, now it's going east. So, the first action is rotation. But what angle? Typically, in robotics, a 90-degree turn would make sense for a right turn because that's a common way to face a new direction quickly without overcomplicating things.

Next up is walking forward. After turning right, the bot has to move ahead. Now, here's where I get a bit stuck. Should it take one full step or multiple steps? Well, since the command doesn't specify distance, maybe just moving one step makes sense as a default. It keeps it simple and prevents confusion if the user expects only a single movement after the turn.

Putting these together, the sequence seems straightforward: rotate right (let's say 90 degrees) and then move forward one unit. That covers both actions clearly without adding unnecessary complexity. I think that's all there is to it.
    ```

    **Motion Plan:** stand still

    **Results:**
    - Similarity: 0.128
    - Success Rate: 100.0%
    - Motion Quality: 0.492
